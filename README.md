- 1,000+ transactions across 3 branches (A, B, C)
- Key metrics: revenue, COGS, product lines, customer demographics, and ratings

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **SQL Queries** (Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis)
- **Data Visualization** (Through query results)

## üìÇ Database Schema
Table: `sales`  
Columns:  
`invoice_id`, `branch`, `city`, `customer_type`, `gender`, `product_line`, `unit_price`, `quantity`, `tax_pct`, `total`, `date`, `time`, `payment`, `cogs`, `gross_margin_pct`, `gross_income`, `rating`

## üîç Key Analyses Performed

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Added time segments (`Morning/Afternoon/Evening`)
- Extracted `day_name` and `month_name` from dates

### 2. **Product Analysis**
- Most sold product line: **Electronic accessories**
- Highest revenue by product: **Food and beverages**
- Product line with highest VAT: **Home and lifestyle**

### 3. **Sales Trends**

```sql
-- Top product line by sales
SELECT product_line, SUM(quantity) AS qty
